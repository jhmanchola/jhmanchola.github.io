<br/>
Colombian, South American. Chili pepper grower. A bit of poetry: "two trees make a forest, two threes make a six". Learned to code late in life but enjoy using it for data mining. Help people out in this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthisbug/" target="blank">subreddit</a>. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture "prof_pic.jpg" and put it in the img folder. 

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/" target="blank">Font Awesome icons</a>, like the ones below. Add your facebook, twitter, linkedin, or just disable all of them.
