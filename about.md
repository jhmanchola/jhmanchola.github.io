<br/>
Colombian, South American. I learned how to code late in life but enjoy using it for data mining / analysis / visualization. 
Previous to that, my personal experience with computers consisted of endless hours of CAD model development.
Unqualified chili pepper grower. A bit of poetry: "two trees make a forest, two threes make a six". 
I enjoy bird watching and trail exploration. Please help people out in this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthisbug/" target="blank">subreddit</a>. 
Reader of books. My favorite bird is the common potoo.
